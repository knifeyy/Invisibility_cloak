# Invisibility_cloak
Harry Potter's invisibility cloak simplified to a python project. 

Make sure you have pygame on your system. Default color for the cloak is white but can be changed. 

Run python test.py to execute. 

Soon : Deploying the application on Streamlit and working on the UI for a better experience.
